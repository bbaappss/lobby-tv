# Deployment

Mimogear integrates with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for deployments to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/). Documentation is included for [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosting and deployments. **Using Travis CI to trigger builds means Mimogear works well with [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) to help edit and commit content online.**

Most of the setup required to host and deploy can be a little tricky but Mimogear aims to make it as simple as possible. Of course, feel free to choose the service that works for you.

## Services

The primary service to integrate with, that will help trigger builds to deploy to a hosting service, is Travis CI. To get started, check out the [Travis CI documentation](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/blob/master/docs/deployment/travis-ci.md) available in Mimogear. netlify can also provide deployments as well.

Mimogear provides a small set of documentation to get started with each mentioned service:

* [github pages documentation](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/blob/master/docs/deployment/gh-pages.md)
* [surge.sh documentation](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/blob/master/docs/deployment/surge.md)
* [netlify documentation](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/blob/master/docs/deployment/netlify.md)
